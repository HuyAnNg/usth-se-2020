The project is aimed at creating a brand new game of type role-playing games (RPG). To be more  
specific, it is of dungeon crawler,a type of scenario in fantasy RPG, in which a plethora of exploring and 
fighting triggered by users' interaction involves.

The number of graphics for game design has been inherited from our former project on Scratch. For
the time being, the game will be elevated to a new level, or put it in another way, it will be 
remastered in a different game engine. There are several to choose from, however, Unity is being
taken into account.

Gameplay is basically how the player makes interactions with the game. 'Turn-based' pattern is 
selected for this gaming project. It is the term for a strategy game where players take turns
when playing.

The biggest motivation for this project can be traced back to Year 1. The original version was
believed to be a unique brainchild, which has laid a solid foundation for itself to be digitally
remastered
